After an intensive and enriching three-day training program, this application was meticulously crafted through a collaborative effort with the esteemed Google Developers Student Club at King Abdulaziz University. The training session served as a catalyst, igniting our passion for innovation and equipping us with the necessary skills and knowledge to embark on this ambitious project. Under the guidance of experienced mentors and through hands-on workshops, we delved deep into the realm of software development, honing our expertise and refining our approach to building impactful solutions.

As a result of our collective efforts and dedication, we are proud to present this application, which stands as a testament to our commitment to advancing education through technology. It is our sincere hope that this application will empower learners, inspire curiosity, and foster a culture of lifelong learning. We extend our heartfelt gratitude to the Google Developers Student Club at King Abdulaziz University for their unwavering support and collaboration throughout this journey.
